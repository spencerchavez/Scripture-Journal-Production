To start, just run the file "bom_runnable".
All data will be stored in data -> entries.txt

If the app is not working:
	-Make sure Java must is installed on your device. If it is not, you can get it online by searching "java jre download". Make sure you select the jre for your operating system.
	-Make sure the "data" folder is in the same folder as the bom_runnable file
	-Was it working before? Your entries.txt file may have become currupted. In this case, delete the entries.txt file and try running the program again.
